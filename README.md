# FS23egr100-adaCircuit

Our collaborative coding center for Project 1 in EGR 100 at MSU for the Adafruit circuit physical template.
All issues can be tacked and are simply ideas for creating the light show. Please feel free to add issues to
  show other ideas you may have so you can document them and others can understand your pull requests (changes
    desired to be pulled into the main branch of code).
