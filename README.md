READ THIS PLEASE: All issues can be tacked and are simply ideas for creating the light show. Please feel free to add issues to
  show other ideas you may have so you can document them and others can understand your pull requests (changes
    desired to be pulled into the main branch of code). Also, this is vital to keeping the main code safe: DO NOT commit any changes
    directly to the main branch. Always commit to your branch and make comment by starting a conversation on your personal branch and
    another person will review it, resolve the conversation, and only then pull it into main.
